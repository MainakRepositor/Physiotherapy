# Exercise_Library_Streamlit_App
This is a very simple web application that personal training clients can use to help remind themselves of the names of exercises and the different ways they can be performed. I have named the exercises as simple and direct as possible due to the many different naming conventions used by many fitness "professionals" out there. Personal trainers can also use it to help them think of new exercises or at least give them new ways of performing the same exercise with their clients. The exercises primarily cater to clients that fall into the "general population" category.

This is not an exhaustive list, but it is enough to start. More exercises may be added in the future.

"Exercises" left out of the dataset include Balance Exercises & Static/Dynamic Stretches
